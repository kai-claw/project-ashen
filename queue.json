      "workerNotes": "FIX v18 (1102740): SIMPLIFIED APPROACH - Use terrain getHeightAt() + 5 for spawn, fallback to y=50 if terrain not ready. Removed complex graduated offset logic (was Y=300-400). IIFE forces terrain generation then calculates proper height BEFORE first render. Spawn safety frames reduced 240->60 (~1 second). Camera stays 3 units above terrain. Terrain max is ~25, so terrain+5 is sufficient. Updated 6 files: main.js (IIFE, simplified animate checks), Player.js (spawn safety), CameraController.js (clampToTerrain), SaveManager.js, SaveIntegration.js, SaveDataSchema.js. Build verified, deployed to gh-pages."
