      "workerNotes": "FIX v9 (4f2af54): Multi-frame spawn safety with forceGenerateAt. Changes: (1) Added TerrainGenerator.forceGenerateAt() method for immediate chunk loading, (2) Added getHeightAt() alias for compatibility, (3) Changed spawn safety from single-frame to 5-frame check to catch race conditions, (4) Added post-cameraController.update() terrain safety check to prevent camera lerping into terrain, (5) Added CameraController._spawnSafetyFrames for increased terrain clamping during spawn period, (6) Reduced fallback heights to sensible values (offset=5, fallback=50). Root cause: race condition where camera lerp could pull camera into terrain during first frames. Build: vite 7.3.1, deployed to gh-pages."
